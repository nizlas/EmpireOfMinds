# Units and scenarios (domain)

## Representation

**`Unit`** (see `res://game/domain/unit.gd`) is a `RefCounted` value object with:

- **`id`**: int — unique within a `Scenario` (enforced at construction).
- **`owner_id`**: int — which player or faction “owns” the unit. `Player` as a class is deferred; only integers are used in Phase 1.4.
- **`position`**: a `HexCoord` — where the unit sits. Must refer to a cell that exists on the map when placed inside a `Scenario`.

Units are **immutable in Phase 1.4**: there are no setters, no `move()`, and no mutators on the type.

## Owner ids

Owner identifiers are plain **integers**. A dedicated `Player` type, naming, and UI palette for owners are all **explicitly deferred**.

## Scenario

**`Scenario`** bundles a **`HexMap`** and a read-only list of **units**. It is:

- **Immutable** after construction: no `add_unit`, `remove_unit`, `move_unit`, or ownership changes.
- **Not** an autoload or singleton.
- **Not** a `Node` — it is pure domain data.

Queries such as `units()`, `unit_by_id`, `units_at`, and `units_owned_by` return information derived from the fixed unit list. `units()` returns a **duplicate** of the list so callers cannot mutate the scenario’s internal array.

**Layer boundary:** what belongs in the domain layer vs. presentation is summarized in [game/domain/README.md](../game/domain/README.md).

## Canonical fixture: `make_tiny_test_scenario()`

The static factory **`Scenario.make_tiny_test_scenario()`** builds a scenario on top of **`HexMap.make_tiny_test_map()`** with **three** units and **two** owner ids **0** and **1**:

- All unit positions are on **PLAINS** hexes: `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`.
- The **WATER** hex at **`(-1,0)`** is **intentionally empty** (no unit there) so water vs land placement stays obvious in tests and docs.

## Explicitly deferred

The following are **out of scope** for Phase 1.4 and must not be assumed from the current types:

- Rendering of units (sprites, labels, health bars)
- Selection and highlighting
- Movement, pathfinding, and actions
- Turn state, phases, and action points
- AI and automation
- Combat resolution
- Save/load
- Ownership transfer, renaming, and rich `Player` modeling
- Owner color palette
- Stacking, zone of control, and similar tactical rules
