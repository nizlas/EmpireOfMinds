# Empire of Minds — Rendering (Phase 1.3+)

## Presentation boundary

- **`game/presentation/`** may use Godot `Node2D` / `CanvasItem` and drawing APIs. It must **not** own authoritative game rules or mutable domain objects as the long-term source of truth.
- **`game/domain/`** remains the home of `HexMap`, `HexCoord`, and other rule-state types. The presentation layer **reads the domain** (e.g. `coords()`, `terrain_at()`) to decide what to draw. **Rendered** geometry is a **derived view**; `HexMap` is still the source of which cells exist and what terrain they have.

## Phase 1.3 approach

- A single **[MapView](../game/presentation/map_view.gd)** `Node2D` overrides **`_draw()`** to fill the screen with the map.
- **`MapView.compute_draw_items(map, layout)`** is a **pure** static helper: it takes a `HexMap` and a [HexLayout](../game/presentation/hex_layout.gd), iterates **`map.coords()`** (the domain list of `HexCoord`), and returns draw lists with world position, hex corners, and colors. It does **not** use a hand-authored coordinate list and does not read `HexMap` internal storage.
- **HexLayout** implements **pointy-top** axial \((q, r) \to\) `Vector2` and six vertex positions for a hex of circumradius 32. See [HEX_COORDINATES.md](HEX_COORDINATES.md) for domain axial meaning; layout orientation is a presentation choice.

## Map-driven coordinates

- Rendered cell positions and counts **derive from** `map.coords()`. The tiny test map from `HexMap.make_tiny_test_map()` is the same domain object used in tests; **no** duplicate fixture list in the view.

## Placeholder terrain palette (Phase 1.3)

- `HexMap.Terrain.PLAINS` — flat greenish `Color(0.50, 0.78, 0.47)`.
- `HexMap.Terrain.WATER` — flat blue `Color(0.20, 0.45, 0.80)`.
- Unknown terrain (should not happen for current enums) — magenta `Color(1, 0, 1)` for visibility.

This is not final art, branding, or a committed palette for release.

## Optional labels (Phase 1.3)

- Coordinate text on tiles is **optional**; the first implementation may draw **polygons only** to stay robust across Godot versions. If labels are added later, they remain presentation-only and must not become gameplay state.

## Explicitly deferred

- `Camera2D` (pan / zoom), parallax, fit-to-screen.
- **Input**, selection, hover, tooltips.
- **TileMap** / `TileSet`, atlases, custom meshes, particles.
- **Animation** (`Tween` / `AnimationPlayer`) for map cells.
- **Theme**, custom **fonts** (other than default).
- Shipped **art** and a **final** terrain palette and accessibility contrast review.
