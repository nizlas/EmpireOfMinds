# Empire of Minds — Cloud Play Strategy

## Vision

Empire of Minds should support asynchronous play-by-cloud.

Players should be able to participate in a long-running turn-based game without being online at the same time.

## Initial Cloud Principle

Do not start by hosting all player games officially.

The project should support Bring Your Own Server / Private Cloud first.

## Supported Modes Over Time

### Local / Hotseat

Single machine. Useful for Phase 1 and early testing.

### Connect to Existing Server

Client connects to a backend URL.

### Private Cloud / Self-Hosted

User runs their own backend, likely via Docker Compose.

### Official Cloud

Optional future service if the project becomes commercial or widely used.

## Cloud Architecture Concept
